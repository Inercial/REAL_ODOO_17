Stock Customs Account Date
==========================

This module changes the functionality of accounting in Odoo. When a product is purchased in a different currency of the company and you have real time inventory accounting, when the goods are received it takes the exchange rate of the date of the purchase order.

With this module, a field Customs Date is added to the picking. If this field is defined it will take the exchange rate of the that date.
